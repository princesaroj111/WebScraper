Smart Web Scraper

# Structure of code
1st part of problem assignment:   refer Package src/main/java/TreeNode.

2nd part of problem statement:  refer Package src/main/java/WebScrapper.

Sample HTML payloads for testing present in src/main/resources.

# Note:
1. There are two Main class present in both packages, you can run it to see the result/working.
2. For webScrapper, List of "a" element is returned in a grid, it can be easily modified to only return href using getAttr("href"). 
  For better visual experience I have printed hrefs in grids.
